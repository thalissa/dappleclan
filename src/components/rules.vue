    p Hey DappleClan Cats,
    p Haha, Tigerflame here! Hi guys, let's go over ALL of the rules for DappleClan. So we have a bunch of rules here, don't be shy to ask us! ...Or maybe afriad of me...I have a stick that I'm not afraid use! Wow, I'm getting off topic! Let's focus on this. Alright, we require you to at least TRY to follow these rules. I can tell if you are :)
    p If you don't follow these rules, you will be given a warning kick unless ordered to ban. If you continue not to follow these rules, you will be banned. The time you are banned is determined by what rule you don't follow. If you continue to do wrong, it could lead you to your membership being deleted or having to be exiled from the clan.

    h2 Main DappleClan and RolePlay DappleClan Chat Rules 
    ul
      li Main DappleClan is used for chatting.
      li Roleplay DappleClan is for Roleplaying.
      li No asking to be a mod, or how to be a mod
      li You MUST be a member of the site to become a member of the chat
      li No cussing. Words that you say don't count as a cuss on your dictionary is a cuss on other's. Curses abriviated/covered are still counted. Some words aren't counted as a swear, for they have another meaning related to Warriors.
      li NO SPAMMING
      li NO BOTHERING A MODERATOR! If you have a complaint, you may then inform an OWNER.
      li No TELLING a Moderator to make one a member unless you are a higher rank. (guest, member, moderator, owner)
      li This is a WARRIOR CAT site, not a Wolf site. Be a warrior Cat or I will ban you.
      li Curse words in your name will bring you to an automatic ban.
      li You are allowed to use any rp style, but some people may judge you instantly. Be as descriptive or non descriptive as you wish, and if anyone complains about it tell them to read the rules.
      li Some people cannot read your name clearly. Please make your name clear. We do not mind simple silly-letters.
      li Report anyone you have a complaint about or a rule you'd like to add.
      li Do not share any personal information!
      li No bullying! (This is a No Bully Zone!)
    h2 Clan Rules
    ul
      li Respect those in higher ranks (AND I MEAN IT!) *NO angering Leaders, Deputies, and the Medicine Cats. Anything you say could EFFECT THEM IN REAL LIFE!*
      li Follow the Warrior Code
      li Try not to cause too much drama O.O (example: one minute there's a flood, next minute there's a fight)
      li Again, NO SPAMMING!
      li A queen may only adopt up to 3 kits and have up to 5 kits
      li No Powers or saying StarClan gave you powers. Try to keep our clan as fair as possible.
      li Female leaders and deputies may not have kits, male leaders and deputies may. Past leaders were allowed to since there was no arguments, but no that the number of discussions of this has risen, we have established this rule.
      li KITS CANNOT HAVE MATES, I DON'T CARE IF IT YOU SAY "But it's my character." KITS CANNOT HAVE MATES! NO KIT MATES! Only close friends. Apprentices may have crushes, and warriors may have mates if they choose to.
      li No making up fake clans such as "VenomClan, a clan of venomous snakes." We only have BreezeClan, WillowClan, and LionClan *formerly CanyonClan*
      li Don't beg to become an apprentice/warrior.
      li Don't make yourself an apprentice/warrior.
      li No using names a cat wouldn't really know. (Such as the word 'galaxy' or 'universe.') 
      li Please report any battles or anyone sick/injured to the Medicine Cats
      li No powerplaying (ex. Bob cut off Joe's tail.)

    p Please report and ask for any rule to be added/changed. Thanks for your time reading this!  li Tigerflame
