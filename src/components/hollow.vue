      summary Fatesong's Writing
      p Greetings, everyone! I'm Fatesong, your current medicine cat! I just recently became full medicine cat. The previous medicine cat, Rainshimmer, was murdered so I had to go to the Whispering Caverns and get my full name.... well, I can't really talk about that, so moving on. 
      p I have been taking some great interest in the history of DappleClan recently. I've discovered that I am distantly related to Icedew, the very first medicine cat of DappleClan. It took a lot of questioning and researching to figure this out. If, at any time, you want to talk to me about DappleClan history, don't hesitate! I'm ready to hear all the stories you have! I guess you could imagine what I was like as a kit. Let's just say, you better be glad you weren't one of the elders who had to tell me the stories!
      p I'm a pure white she-cat with deep, deep blue eyes. I'm a long-hair, so my fur is pretty fluffy. My claws, though you don't see them very often, are black with silver rings on them. My mother's name is Destinyheart, and my father's name is Corremtail. I look just like my mother so she named me after her. I am calm tempered and you would have to work really hard to make me mad. I am easy to teach and ready to learn. I except cats for who they are, and I forgive easily. I love to play but when it's time, I am serious and hard to distract from whatever I'm doing. I am a good secret keeper and very trustable. There are only three ways to make me mad:
      p 1.) When other cats do my job for me when I am standing right there
      p 2.) When you lie to me
      p 3.) When everyone tells me what to use on a hurt cat
      p I hope I get to know you and can become friends with you! If you see me around, don't hesitate to talk to me, and if you have a question, go ahead and ask!
